The 0x06-starwars_api project involves creating scripts that interact with the Star Wars API to retrieve and display information about Star Wars movies and characters. By using the request module in JavaScript, you will write scripts that make HTTP requests to the API, parse JSON responses, and handle asynchronous operations to display data such as character names in a specified order. This project provides practice with API consumption, asynchronous programming, and command-line arguments in JavaScript.
