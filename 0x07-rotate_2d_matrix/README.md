0x07-rotate_2d_matrix
This project involves rotating a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place. The matrix is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row. The task focuses on modifying the matrix without using extra space, demonstrating a strong understanding of algorithmic manipulation and in-place data transformations.
